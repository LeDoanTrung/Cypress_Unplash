## Description
This project is a Cypress framework designed for testing the Unsplash application. It includes various services and utilities to facilitate API testing and UI testing.

## Features 💡

* Atomic and Independent test cases
* Robust Locator strategies to target elements
* No hard coded strings and test data in spec files
* Hooks to perform the repeated steps for all the tests inside spec
* Loading test data from external fixtures files i.e. JSON
* Generate random test data with faker library
* Loading environment specific configuration and environment variables per environment i.e. dev, stage, prod
* Ability to filter and run tests with specific tags i.e. regression, smoke
* Pass browser and mode as environment variable
* Configure routes (URL endpoints) in a constant config file
* Usage of OOP Inheritance to extend all the pages from BasePage
  * Allows to load header and footer components from BasePage constructor
  * Call the `cy.visit()` from BasePage with specified path
* Test Retries for failing tests
* Custom commands for login and validation in `cypress/support/commands.js`
* Intellisense for custom commands in `cypress/support/index.d.ts`
* Reusable test utilities functions inside `cypress/e2e/utils` 
* Support for Cypress Cloud (Dashboard)
* Multiple reporters configuration (JUnit XML, cpress-mochawesome-reporter HTML) 
* Cypress with Docker using Dockerfile and docker-compose
* Continuous Integration CI with Jenkins 


## Setup 🛠️

### Pre-requisites

* Install NodeJS and NPM pakcage manager.
* Code Editor of your choice e.g. Visual Studio Code
  * Install [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) VS Code extension from Microsoft to make linting work in IDE
* GIT Client (for remote tracking)
* GIT Bash terminal (for Windows)

#### Optional
* Install [Cypress Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CliffSu.cypress-snippets) VS Code Extension that includes the most common cypress snippets.

### Setup from Scratch

* `npm init` to setup node project with package.json
* `npm install --save-dev cypress` to install cypress as dev dependency
* `npx cypress open` to open the cypress test runner and choose `E2E Testing` which will create cypress config, support and fixture folders.
* Choose browser of your choice, and scaffold examples which will create boilerplate specs within e2e folder.
* Remove the default boilerplate specs from `cypress/e2e` folder
* Add `.gitignore` to exclude files and folders from GIT
* Add `README.md` to document
* Start with writing tests under `cypress/e2e` directory.

## Project Structure
- `cypress/fixtures`: Contains test data files.
- `cypress/e2e/test`: Contains test cases.
- `cypress/e2e/page`: Contains page object.
- `cypress/support`: Contains custom commands and utilities.
- `cypress/service`: Contains service classes for API interactions.
- `cypress/constant`: Contains constant values used across the project, such as API endpoints and configuration settings.
- `settings` : Contains configuration files for different environments and other project-specific settings.

## Jenkins Integration
This project includes a `Jenkinsfile` for setting up a Jenkins pipeline. The `Jenkinsfile` is located in the root directory of the project and defines the stages for installing dependencies, running tests, and generating reports.

To set up the Jenkins pipeline:
1. Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
2. In the pipeline configuration, point to the repository containing this project.
3. Jenkins will automatically detect the `Jenkinsfile` and use it to configure the pipeline.

## Cypress Cloud ☁️

* Record a run to see your test results in Cypress Cloud. You can then optimize your test suite, debug failing and flaky tests, Test Replay, watch video, view console output and screenshots, and integrate with your favorite tools.
* [Cypress Cloud documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction)
* [Cypress Project ID and Record Key](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/account-management/projects)
* [Record tests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Record-tests)
  * Once you set up your project to record, Cypress generates a unique projectId for your project and automatically insert it into your Cypress configuration file. The projectId is a 6 character string in your Cypress configuration.
  * The record key is used to authenticate that your project is allowed to record tests to Cypress Cloud. As long as your record key stays private, no one will be able to record test runs for your project - even if they have your projectId.
  * Create `cypress.env.json` in root directory that Cypress will automatically check. Values in here will overwrite conflicting environment variables in your Cypress configuration.This strategy is useful because if you add cypress.env.json to your `.gitignore` file, the values in here can be different for each developer machine.
  ```json
  {
    "projectId": ""
  }
  ```

## Github Actions

* This project also includes a cypress.yml file for setting up a GitHub Actions workflow. The cypress.yml file is located in the .github/workflows directory and defines the steps for running the Cypress tests on GitHub Actions.

* Setting Up GitHub Actions
To set up GitHub Actions for this project:

    - Ensure the cypress.yml file is located in the .github/workflows directory.
    - GitHub Actions will automatically detect the cypress.yml file and use it to configure the workflow.
