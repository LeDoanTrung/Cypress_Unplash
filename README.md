## Description
This project is a Cypress framework designed for testing the Unsplash application. It includes various services and utilities to facilitate API testing and UI testing.

## Features üí°

* Atomic and Independent test cases
* Robust Locator strategies to target elements
* No hard coded strings and test data in spec files
* Hooks to perform the repeated steps for all the tests inside spec
* Loading test data from external fixtures files i.e. JSON
* Generate random test data with faker library
* Loading environment specific configuration and environment variables per environment i.e. dev, stage, prod
* Ability to filter and run tests with specific tags i.e. regression, smoke
* Pass browser and mode as environment variable
* Configure routes (URL endpoints) in a constant config file
* Usage of OOP Inheritance to extend all the pages from BasePage
  * Allows to load header and footer components from BasePage constructor
  * Call the `cy.visit()` from BasePage with specified path
* Test Retries for failing tests
* Custom commands for login and validation in `cypress/support/commands.js`
* Intellisense for custom commands in `cypress/support/index.d.ts`
* Reusable test utilities functions inside `cypress/e2e/utils` 
* Support for Cypress Cloud (Dashboard)
* Multiple reporters configuration (JUnit XML, cpress-mochawesome-reporter HTML) 
* Cypress with Docker using Dockerfile and docker-compose
* Continuous Integration CI with Jenkins 


## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

### Pre-requisites

* Install NodeJS and NPM pakcage manager.
* Code Editor of your choice e.g. Visual Studio Code
  * Install [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) VS Code extension from Microsoft to make linting work in IDE
* GIT Client (for remote tracking)
* GIT Bash terminal (for Windows)

#### Optional
* Install [Cypress Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CliffSu.cypress-snippets) VS Code Extension that includes the most common cypress snippets.

### Setup from Scratch

* `npm init` to setup node project with package.json
* `npm install --save-dev cypress` to install cypress as dev dependency
* `npx cypress open` to open the cypress test runner and choose `E2E Testing` which will create cypress config, support and fixture folders.
* Choose browser of your choice, and scaffold examples which will create boilerplate specs within e2e folder.
* Remove the default boilerplate specs from `cypress/e2e` folder
* Add `.gitignore` to exclude files and folders from GIT
* Add `README.md` to document
* Start with writing tests under `cypress/e2e` directory.

## Jenkins Integration
This project includes a `Jenkinsfile` for setting up a Jenkins pipeline. The `Jenkinsfile` is located in the root directory of the project and defines the stages for installing dependencies, running tests, and generating reports.

To set up the Jenkins pipeline:
1. Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
2. In the pipeline configuration, point to the repository containing this project.
3. Jenkins will automatically detect the `Jenkinsfile` and use it to configure the pipeline.
